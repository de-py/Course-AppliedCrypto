# Problem 1

This program will decrypt a cookie like encryption that uses ecb

## Getting Started

For this, you need the rypto.py file in the week4 and one.py in the week5 directory.
Also you need a file you wish to decrypt that is currently in base64.

If you don't have these libraries, pip install them.

    pip install pycrypto
    pip install cryptography

Running the following command will get you started:

    python one.py

## Assumption

If you don't have these libraries,

    pip install pycrypto
    pip instal cryptography

The counter only goes through 50 iterations. This seemed like plenty. No need to calculate the length added for this assignment. If it doesn't work, add more to the number 50 in the for loop of the c section.
