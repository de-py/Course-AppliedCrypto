# Problem 1

Discover key when IV = KEY

## Getting Started

For this, you need the rypto.py file in the week10 and one.py in the week10 directory.


If you don't have these libraries, pip install them.

    pip install pycrypto
    pip install cryptography

Running the following command will get you started:

    python one.py



## Info

If url is longer than 3 blocks, it will use the first three blocks to get the key


# Problem 2

This program implements a keyed sha1 mac

## Getting Started

For this, you need the rypto.py AND sha1.py file in the week10 and two.py in the week10 directory.


If you don't have these libraries, pip install them.

    pip install pycrypto
    pip install cryptography

Running the following command will get you started:

    python two.py



## Info
Given the language in the assignment, I chose to pull copy of sha1 from the net. I have access to the file so I assume this is enough.
I did not alter it one bit so I hope that was not the goal of this.
